# Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python, making it a valuable tool for chemists looking to process experimental data, chemical properties, or any structured data related to their research.

It's like the Excel in Python. 

## Setting Up Your Environment
First, ensure you are in a conda environment. You can then install Pandas and Numpy using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy
```
or 

```sh
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
```

## Importing Libraries
Start your Python script or Jupyter notebook by importing Pandas and Numpy:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Creating a DataFrame
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). For a chemistry application, let's consider a simple example where we have a dataset of several compounds with their molecular weights and melting points.

```python
data = {
    "Compound": ["Water", "Ethanol", "Glucose", "Sodium Chloride", "Methane"],
    "Molecular Weight": [18.015, 46.07, 180.16, 58.44, 16.04],
    "Melting Point (째C)": [0, -114.1, 146, 801, -182.5]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## Basic Data Inspection
Pandas provides numerous functions to quickly inspect your data:

- `df.head()` displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.
- `df.describe()` gives a statistical summary of the numerical columns.
- `df.dtypes` shows the data type of each column.

## Accessing Data
You can access specific columns using their labels:

```python
mw = df["Molecular Weight"]
```

Or use conditions to filter data:

```python
solids = df[df["Melting Point (째C)"] > 25]
```

## Operations
Pandas supports various operations that can be useful in chemistry, such as calculating the mean, median, or applying more complex functions:

```python
average_mw = df["Molecular Weight"].mean()
```

You can also apply functions to transform data, such as converting temperatures:

```python
df["Melting Point (째F)"] = df["Melting Point (째C)"].apply(lambda x: x * 9/5 + 32)
```
