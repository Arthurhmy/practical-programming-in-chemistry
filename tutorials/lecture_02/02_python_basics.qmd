# Python Tutorial for Chemists

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of Python, which is an incredibly versatile and powerful programming language. Python is widely used in all fields of science, including Chemistry, due to its simplicity and flexibility. Specifically, we will focus on the concept of variables and types, then comparison and conditional operators.

## Variables and Types

A large part of programming involves manipulating variables - containers that hold data. A variable can be of different types - integer, float, string, among others. Python automatically assigns a variable the type that is appropriate for its value.

### Integer 

An Integer variable holds integer values. In Python, you don't have to specify the type of a variable when you create it. When you assign an integer value to a variable, Python knows that the variable is an integer.

Let's see an example:

```python
atom_count = 6
print(atom_count)
print(type(atom_count))
```

This will output: 

```python
6
<class 'int'>
```

In chemistry, there are many times when we use integers. For example, number of moles, number of atoms etc.

### Float 

Float stands for 'floating point number'. You can use it for rational numbers, usually ending with a decimal figure, such as 1.11 or 3.14.

```python
atomic_weight_carbon = 12.01
print(atomic_weight_carbon)
print(type(atomic_weight_carbon))
```

This will output: 

```python
12.01
<class 'float'>
```

In chemistry, atomic weights, concentration values etc are commonly represented as floating point numbers.

### String 

In Python, String variables are used to store textual data, a sequence of characters.

```python
element_name = "Carbon"
print(element_name)
print(type(element_name))
```

This will output: 

```python
Carbon
<class 'str'>
```

In chemistry, we often deal with strings when handling names of compounds, elements etc.

### Exercises

Now that we have learned about Variables and Types in Python, let's test your understanding with the following exercises:

1. Create an integer variable named `molecule_count` and assign it a value of 20. Print its value and type.

2. Create a float variable named `molar_mass_oxygen` and assign it a value of 16.00. Print its value and type.

3. Create a string variable named `chemical_formula_water` and assign it a value of "H2O". Print its value and type.

4. Change the value of `molecule_count` to 50. Print the new value.

5. Change the `chemical_formula_water` to "D2O". Print the new value.

### Solutions

Solution 1:

```python
molecule_count = 20
print(molecule_count)
print(type(molecule_count))
```

Solution 2:

```python
molar_mass_oxygen = 16.00
print(molar_mass_oxygen)
print(type(molar_mass_oxygen))
```

Solution 3:

```python
chemical_formula_water = "H2O"
print(chemical_formula_water)
print(type(chemical_formula_water))
```

Solution 4:

```python
molecule_count = 50
print(molecule_count)
```

Solution 5:

```python
chemical_formula_water = "D2O"
print(chemical_formula_water)
```


# Operators in Python

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

```python
number_of_atoms = 12
# Addition
print(number_of_atoms + 5) #Output: 17
 
# Subtraction
print(number_of_atoms - 5) #Output: 7

# Multiplication
print(number_of_atoms * 5) #Output: 60

# Division
print(number_of_atoms / 3) #Output: 4.0
```

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables. There are various types of assignment operators in Python.

```python
x = 5  # x is now 5
print(x)

x += 3 # same as x = x + 3; x is now 8
print(x)

x -= 1 # same as x = x - 1; x is now 7
print(x)

x *= 2 # same as x = x * 2; x is now 14
print(x)

x /= 7 # same as x = x / 7; x is now 2.0
print(x)
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in Python to compare values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.

```python
#Suppose we have two variables
a = 5
b = 10

print(a == b) #Output: False

print(a != b) #Output: True

print(a < b)  #Output: True

print(a > b)  #Output: False

print(a <= b) #Output: True

print(a >= b) #Output: False
```
In chemistry, comparison operators could be useful in checking equivalences, for example, if two volumes or two masses are equal, or if one is greater or smaller than the other.

### Exercises 

1. Calculate the atomic weight of CO2 (C=12.01, O=16.00).
2. Create a variable containing number of moles of oxygen and calculate the weight.
3. Check if the weight of five moles of carbon is equal to the weight of 10 moles.
4. Perform an operation with assignment operator on a mole variable.
5. Check if the weight of a mole of hydrogen is less than the weight of a mole of helium (H=1.01, He=4.00).

### Solutions

Solution 1:

```python
C = 12.01
O = 16.00

CO2 = C + (O * 2)
print(CO2)  #Output: 44.01
```

Solution 2:

```python
# Lets assume we have 6 moles of oxygen
moles_of_oxygen = 6
weight = moles_of_oxygen * O

print(weight) #Output: 96.0
```

Solution 3:

```python
# Carbon weight for 5 moles
carbon_weight_for_5_moles = 5 * C

# Carbon weight for 10 moles
carbon_weight_for_10_moles = 10 * C

print(carbon_weight_for_5_moles == carbon_weight_for_10_moles) #Output: False
```

Solution 4:

```python
# Initial mole value
moles_of_hydrogen = 10

# Perform assignment operation
moles_of_hydrogen *= 2  # Same as moles_of_hydrogen = moles_of_hydrogen * 2

print(moles_of_hydrogen) #Output: 20
```

Solution 5:

```python
H = 1.01  # Atomic weight of Hydrogen
He = 4.00  # Atomic weight of Helium

print(H < He)  #Output: True
``` 


# Handling Floating Point Numbers in Python

Indeed, performing operations on floating point numbers may sometimes yield unexpected results. This unusual behavior is due to the internal representation of these numbers as binary fractions, which can cause rounding errors.

Here's an example to illustrate this issue:

```python
x = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
y = 0.3
print(x == y)  #Output: False
```

You might expect the output to be `True` since `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1` is `0.3`. But it's not!

This is because floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions and most decimal fractions cannot be exactly represented as binary fractions results in small roundoff errors.

But don't worry, Python provides a solution to this problem.

Enter the `round()` function!

The `round()` function rounds a floating point number to the nearest integer if no number of digits is specified, otherwise it rounds to the specified number of digits.

```python
x = round(0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1, 2)
y = round(0.3, 2)
print(x == y)  #Output: True
```

Use the `round()` function when you need precise calculation with floating point numbers.

Another solution is to use the `math.isclose()` function, which checks whether two values are close enough (within some tolerance) to consider them equal:

```python
import math

x = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
y = 0.3

print(math.isclose(x, y))  #Output: True
```

In this code snippet, we use the `isclose()` function to check if `x` and `y` are approximately equal, considering some small error. This function is quite handy when working with floating point arithmetic!

Another important note: If precision really matters in your calculations and rounding or checking closeness still doesn't seem acceptable, you may want to look into using the `decimal` module in Python, which was designed specifically to handle more precise floating-point arithmetic.

### Practice

Try to calculate the molar mass of benzene with a precision up to 3 decimal places, given that:

- Carbon (C): 12.0096
- Hydrogen (H): 1.0079

Benzene's formula is C6H6.

### Solution

```python
C = 12.0096
H = 1.0079

benzene_molar_mass = round((C * 6) + (H * 6), 3)
print(benzene_molar_mass)  #Output: 78.114
```
In this code snippet, the `round()` function helps prevent any unwanted inaccuracies.


# Conditionals in Python

Conditionals are used to perform different computations or actions depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

## If Statements

In Python, `if` statement is used for conditional execution.

```python

temperature = 25

if temperature > 20:
    print("It's warm outside") 
```

In this example, the message `It's warm outside` is printed to the screen if the temperature is higher than 20.

## Elif and Else Statements

Python supports multiple conditions in one if statement using `elif` (abbreviation of else if). The `else` clause serves as a default condition; its block is executed when none of the conditions is true.

```python
pH = 3

if pH < 7:
    print("Solution is acidic") 
elif pH > 7:
    print("Solution is alkaline")
else:
    print("Solution is neutral")
```

In this example, information about the nature of a solution given its pH is printed to the screen.

## Using Logical Operators

Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) allow to build more complex conditional statements.

```python
temperature = 25
pressure = 2

if temperature > 20 and pressure > 1:
    print("Reaction rate will be high!") 

if not temperature < 20:
    print("It's not cold outside") 
```

In these examples, a message about reaction rate is printed to the screen if both temperature is higher than 20 and pressure is higher than 1. The second condition checks if the temperature is not lower than 20.

## Ternary Operator (Conditional Expressions)

Python supports one more conditional expression which is called ternary operator:

```python
message = "It's warm outside" if temperature > 20 else "It's cold outside"
print(message)
```

Here, the message about the weather is chosen based on the temperature.

### Exercises 

1. Write a program that prints out whether a solution with a given pH is acidic, alkaline or neutral.
2. Write a program that prints out whether a reaction will be feasible given its enthalpy (∆H) and entropy (∆S). A reaction is feasible if ∆H < 0 and ∆S > 0.
3. Write a program that prints out whether a substance is solid, liquid or gas given its boiling point and the current temperature.
4. Write a program that uses logical operators to print out whether the reaction rate will be high given temperature and pressure.
5. Use a ternary operator to print out whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic given its ∆H.

### Solutions

Solution 1:

```python
pH = 8

if pH < 7:
    print("Solution is acidic") 
elif pH > 7:
    print("Solution is alkaline")
else:
    print("Solution is neutral")
```

Solution 2:

```python
delta_H = -30
delta_S = 10

if delta_H < 0 and delta_S > 0:
    print("Reaction is feasible!") 
else:
    print("Reaction is not feasible!")
```

Solution 3:

```python
boiling_point = 100
temperature = 50

if temperature < boiling_point:
    print("Substance is solid or liquid!")
else:
    print("Substance is gas!")
```

Solution 4:

```python
temperature = 25
pressure = 2

if temperature > 20 and pressure > 1:
    print("Reaction rate will be high!") 
else:
    print("Reaction rate will be moderate or low!")
```

Solution 5:

```python
delta_H = -10

message = "Reaction is exothermic" if delta_H < 0 else "Reaction is endothermic"
print(message)
``` 

# Type Conversion in Python

Sometimes, it's necessary to perform conversions between the built-in types. To convert between types, you simply use the type name as a function. 

There are several built-in functions that allow you to convert data types. These functions include `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.

In applications like Chemistry, type conversion becomes handy while doing mathematical calculations or concatenating strings and numbers.

## Converting to Integer

To convert a value to an integer, you use the `int()` function. For example:

```python
x = "123"
y = int(x)
print(y) #Output: 123
print(type(y)) #Output: <class 'int'>
```

## Converting to Float

To convert a value to a float, you use the `float()` function. For example:

```python
x = "123.45"
y = float(x)
print(y) #Output: 123.45
print(type(y)) #Output: <class 'float'>
```

## Converting to String

To convert a value to a string, you use the `str()` function:

```python
x = 123
y = str(x)
print(y) #Output: '123'
print(type(y)) #Output: <class 'str'>
```

This conversion is especially helpful when you want to concatenate some text with a number:

```python
x = "The atomic number of Carbon is: " + str(6)
print(x) #Output: The atomic number of Carbon is: 6
```

### Exercises 

1. Convert the string `'6.02'` to float.
2. Convert the float `1.0079` to string.
3. Print the sentence: "The atomic weight of Hydrogen is: " and then the atomic weight, provided as a float.
4. Convert the string `'78'` to integer.
5. Print the sentence: "The atomic number of Oxygen is: ", and then atomic number, provided as an integer.

### Solutions 

Solution 1:

```python
x = "6.02"
y = float(x)
print(y) #Output: 6.02
```

Solution 2:

```python
x = 1.0079
y = str(x)
print(y) #Output: '1.0079'
```

Solution 3:

```python
atomic_weight_hydrogen = 1.0079
message = "The atomic weight of Hydrogen is: " + str(atomic_weight_hydrogen)
print(message) #Output: The atomic weight of Hydrogen is: 1.0079
```

Solution 4:

```python
x = "78"
y = int(x)
print(y) #Output: 78
```

Solution 5:

```python
atomic_number_oxygen = 8
message = "The atomic number of Oxygen is: " + str(atomic_number_oxygen)
print(message) #Output: The atomic number of Oxygen is: 8
```
As seen from these examples, type conversion is an essential utility in Python as working between different data types is quite common. Keep in mind that each of the type conversion functions (float, str, etc.) returns a new object and does not modify the original object.


# Assignment/Increment Operators

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables. One of the simplest forms of assignment operator is `=`, for example:

```python
x = 5
```

Here, `5` is assigned to the variable `x`.

## Increment Operator

An increment operator is an operator that increases the value of a variable by 1. This is often used in loops and other control structures. Python does not technically have built-in increment operators like some languages such as C++, but it provides equivalent mechanisms.

The typical way of incrementing a variable in Python is `x = x + 1`.

But Python provides a shorthand to do the same, `x += 1`. 

Here are some examples:

```python
x = 5

# incrementing the value
x = x + 1
print(x) # Output: 6

# Alternate way to increment the value
x += 1
print(x) # Output: 7
```

## Other Arithmetic Assignment Operators

In addition to `+=`, there are other arithmetic assignment operators:

- `-=`: Decreases the current value of the variable by the specified amount.
- `*=`: Multiplies the current value of the variable by the specified amount.
- `/=`: Divides the current value of the variable by the specified amount.
- `**=`: Raises the current value of the variable to the power of the specified amount.
- `//=`: Performs floor division on the current value of the variable.
- `%=`: Modulo assignment, provides the remainder of the division.

Here are examples of using these operators:

```python
x = 10
x -= 2  # equivalent to x = x - 2
print(x) # Output: 8

x = 5
x *= 3  # equivalent to x = x * 3
print(x) # Output: 15

x = 20
x /= 4  # equivalent to x = x / 4
print(x) # Output: 5.0

x = 3
x **= 2  # equivalent to x = x ** 2
print(x) # Output: 9

x = 10
x //= 3  # equivalent to x = x // 3
print(x) # Output: 3

x = 17
x %= 5  # equivalent to x = x % 5
print(x) # Output: 2
```

Experiment with these different assignment operators to become familiar with them, they can simplify your code and make it easier to read.

### Exercises 

1. Start with a variable x with a value of 4. Increment its value by 3.

2. Start with a variable y with a value of 10. Decrease its value by 6.

3. Start with a variable z with a value of 9. Multiply its value by 5.

4. Start with a variable a with a value of 100. Divide its value by 20.

5. Start with a variable b with a value of 5. Raise its value to the power of 3.

### Solutions

Solution 1:

```python
x = 4
x += 3
print(x) # Output: 7
```

Solution 2:

```python
y = 10
y -= 6
print(y) # Output: 4
```

Solution 3:

```python
z = 9
z *= 5
print(z) # Output: 45
```

Solution 4:

```python
a = 100
a /= 20
print(a) # Output: 5.0
```

Solution 5:

```python
b = 5
b **= 3
print(b) # Output: 125
```

Through these exercises, you learn how to assign and modify variables using the different types of assignment operators available in Python. They can ease your code writing, making it simpler and more efficient.
